	Follow Me
Take my hand and follow me
to that place I long to be.
Take my hand and trust my way,
in that place forever stay.
Follow me toward the sand;
we'll run and play, hand in hand.
Take my heart and hold it true;
forever I'll stay close to you.
Seize my words and listen well,
then forever I will tell.
Release your heart and feelings too,
just as I will do for you.
Trust your heart and follow me,
to that place we long to be.

	Up In The Sky
When you are down
And you want to get high,
Just take a good look
Up in the sky.

What you will see
Are the stars above,
And all you need
Is to proclaim your love.

Who you will find
And see so clear,
Are friends in mind
You want to hold near.

Whenever you need them
Just look up high,
Call their name
And see them fly.

Every friend you meet
Owns a star
And you can see them
No matter how far.

Whenever you are down
And want to get high,
Just take a good look
Up in the sky.
